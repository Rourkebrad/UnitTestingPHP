# UnitTestingPHP
In this project, you'll be adding unit tests to an existing application to ensure that it is functioning as intended. The project you'll be testing is a directory of PHP Conferences. Once you are confident in the current features being tested, you'll be ready to extend the application by adding a new feature, a listing image, as defined in the included test case. Adding this new feature should not conflict with existing features, meaning all your tests, plus the new feature tests should pass.
To get the exceeds I have edited the phpunit.xml file to allow for code coverage report.
All three classes report 200% code coverage also.
